## Getting Started P2E

> <br>[P2E or Play-to-earn](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/play-to-earn-play2earn) is a form of game that helps players receive a certain benefit or reward when they participate in the game (mainly using NFT or a token to stake in a single or multiple pools).

## Getting Started PTT

You currently have 3 inputs to fill manually. The first one is the token price which indicates the current price of the token you are using (ETH/MATIC/AVAX/etc..), note that you can use any fiat currency as a base such as (EUR/USD/GBP/etc..).

You can easily check the current price of the token by using any live charts website such as [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) or [DexScreener](https://dexscreener.com/) for example.

#### Fork the project

If you want to contribute by developing your own tool, feel free to use the already existing code. 

##### Prerequisite : Installing NodeJS

Make sure that you have a recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/download/) on your machine.
You might want to use an IDE of your choice, we recommand [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) if you don't have one yet.   

Depending on your installation you might have access to both [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/download/) and [npm](https://nodejs.dev/download/), you can check if either are on your machine by running the command below. 

**You may check your node & npm version by running**:

```bash
npm --version 
node --version
```

Note that in this repository whenever you see `npm` it will be assumed that it is the **latest version** of the package.
<br>

**Installing dependencies**
```bash
npm install -g
```
<br>

**Run SASS (update SCSS modifications)**
```bash
sass --watch src/scss:dist/css
```
After each modification of any file in the src/scss folder, the change should be applied and replicated on the index.html file. Note that the compiled SCSS file will be created in a separate folder dist/css which will be used by default. 
<br>

**Run PTT on localhost**
```bash
npm run dev
```
